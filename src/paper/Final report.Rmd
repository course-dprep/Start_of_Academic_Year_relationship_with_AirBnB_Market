## 1. Introduction

#### *1.1 Problem background and research motivation*

At the start of the academic year, many university students need temporary accommodation while they are arranging their documents and looking for permanent housing. Therefore, they often stay temporarily at Airbnb accommodations. In a recent study on the determinants of Airbnb listings' performance, Sainaghi et al. (2021) conclude that seasonality and certain events can have a significant impact on the prices of listings. Hence, this project aims to investigate how the Airbnb market in various Western-European cities is related to the period of the start of the academic year. The research will focus on analyzing the relationships between the start of the academic year and the Airbnb prices, as well as the maximum nights an accommodation can be booked for. In addition, the effect of the type of host (ordinary vs professional) and type of accommodation (room vs apartment) on the abovementioned relationships will be investigated.

The research will be executed for five major student cities in three Western-European countries: Belgium (Antwerp, Brussels), Germany (Berlin), The Netherlands (Amsterdam, Rotterdam).

#### *1.2 Problem statement and research questions*

Because of the arrival of many university students who have to arrange the start of their university career, we expect this affects the Airbnb market in Western-European cities. This leads to the following main research question:

**To what extent does the start of the academic year affect the Airbnb market in popular student cities in Europe?**

To investigate this research questions, we produced some subquestions to gain a deeper insight in the effects on the Airbnb market. These will be:

\- How are the Airbnb prices related to the period of the academic year (beginning vs regular period)?

\- How does the relationship between Airbnb prices and period of the academic year depend on the type of host (ordinary vs superhost)?

\- How does the relationship between Airbnb prices and period of the academic year depend on the type of accommodation (room vs apartment)?

\- How is the maximum number of nights per accommodation related to the period of the academic year (beginning vs regular period)?

\- How does the relationship between the maximum number of nights per accommodation and period of the academic year depend on the type of host (ordinary vs superhost)?

\- How does the relationship between the maximum number of nights per accommodation and period of the academic year depend on the type of accommodation (room vs apartment)?

#### *1.3 Conceptual model*

To answer our research questions, we designed the following conceptual model. We think there is an effect of the start of the academic year on the price and the maximum number of nights a listing is available. In addition, we think these effects might be moderated by the type of host (whether a host has the 'superhost' badge or not) and the type of accommodation (a private, shared or hotel room versus an entire apartment)

## 2. Methodology

#### *2.1 Data*
##### Data exploration raw data 
For this project we used publicly available archival data from Airbnb. In total, ten datasets were retrieved from the website www.insideairbnb.com, two for each city of interest. First the raw data was explored. For this we looked at the variable of interest to our research question. For the metric variables we made boxplots and took the summary statistics. For the categorical variable we took the count of each one to get a insight into their comperative numbers. 

|Maximum nights | | | | | | |
|Dataset: | Min. | 1st quartile | Median | Mean | 3rd quartile | Max. |
|:----------|:------------|:------------|:-------------|:-------------|:-------------|:-------------|
| Antwerp   | 1    |   35 |  365   |  617   |  1125   | 1125    |
| Amsterdam  |  1   |  22  |  180   |  493   | 1125    |  1825   |
| Brussels  |  1   |  90  |  365   | 631.8    | 1125    | 1555    |
| Berlin  |  1   | 29   |  365   |  518.2   | 1125     | 9999    |
| Rotterdam  |   1  |  30  |  365   |  515.8   |  1125   |  1125   |

*Maximum Nights*
All dataset have the logical min. maximum number of nights at 1.The 3rd quartile number is the same for all cities. Brussels, Berlin and Rotterdam all have the same median. All the max. And 3rd quartile numbers don’t make much sense as they are so high that it would mean you could rent the property for several years in a row. Likely this is some automatically filled in number or people don’t think about it. Based on the differences between the median and mean for every city, the mean likely isn’t representative and heavily influenced by the large outliers. But even the median is very high as apparently you can rent out the property for a full year. 

|Price|
|Dataset: | Min. | 1st quartile | Median | Mean | 3rd quartile | Max. |
|----------|------------|------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Antwerp   |  14   | 60   |  85  |  129   | 129    | 5800    |
| Amsterdam  |  0   |  115  |  160  |  218.8   |  249   | 18400    |
| Brussels  | 0    |  52  | 75   |  102.4   | 104    | 4112    |
| Berlin   |  0   | 40   |  61  | 93.52    | 100    | 24999    |
| Rotterdam  |   0  | 75   |  109  |  143.3   |  155   | 3261    |

*Price*
For price there are very different outputs for all cities. Three cities have 0 as their minimum price, which doesn't make sense as that would mean the property was available for free. So likely this means that the property is rented out or not available. Looking at the median and mean Amsterdam is the most pricy city. Followed by Rotterdam, Antwerp, Brussels and then Berlin. The max. For many of the cities is also insanely high, so far off from the median and mean that once again this is likely some automatic fill out to indicate it’s not available or a scrapping error. For all cities the price compared from the 1st quartile to the 3rd quartile is doubled, this can be because they are different types of rooms and have different price ranges. Or increase in price based on the tourist season or not. 

|Minimum nights|
|Dataset: | Min. | 1st quartile | Median | Mean | 3rd quartile | Max. |
|----------|------------|------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Antwerp  |  1 |  1 |   2 |   5.625  |  3   |  500  |
| Amsterdam  | 1   |  2 |  3  |  4.61   |  4   |  1001  |
| Brussels |  1  | 1  |  2  |  10.56   |  5   |  1125  |
| Berlin   |  1  | 2  | 3   | 13.29    |   5  |  1124  |
| Rotterdam  |  1  |  1 |  2  |  5.976   |  4   | 360   |

*Minumum Nights*
The minimum nights variable is similar for all cities. The mean once again differs greatly from the median and each city has a very large max. Values. So likely the outliers impact the mean strongly. The 2-3 minimum number of nights makes sense as cleaning and such gets more expensive and more to deal with the more often you have to do it. Demanding guest stay 2 nights is to lower the workload for the property manager. 

| | Room_type |  |  |  |  | Host_is_superhost |
|Dataset: | Entire home/apt| Hotel room | Private room | Shared room | False | True |
|----------|------------|------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Antwerp  | 586,172 |3650 | 142,715 | 1825 | 575,952 |158,410 |
| Amsterdam  | 1,541,395 | 27740 | 671,600 | 11680 | 1,858,215 | 394,200 |
| Brussels | 1,480,440 | 14600 | 550,055 | 8030 | 1,729,005 | 324,120 |
| Berlin   | 3,535,025 | 55115 | 2,334,175 | 67525 | 5,231,180 | 757,010 |
| Rotterdam | 231,775 | 4745 | 111,690 | 5840 | 278,495 | 75555 |

*Categorical variables*
Antwerp and Rotterdam are the smallest datasets. Berlin is the largest followed by Amsterdam and then Brussels. For all dataset the room_type show the same ratio for each type. Entire home has the largest occurrence count, followed by Private room, then Hotel room and finally Shared room. So as the difference in counts are so large the decision was made to group Hotel room, private room and shared room together as one group. 

##### Data Transformation

Every two datasets per city were merged into one, based on listing ID. Afterwards, the data was explored and prepared.

A selection was made for all cities to take the dates from 15th of March to the 15th of April 2023 and then from 15th of August to the 15th of September 2022. The first as our control dates and the second as the start of the academic year. We felt we had to pick a month with no major national holidays or religious occasions which could impact the prices.

We only selected the variables which interested us when loading the data for each city into a dataframe, which were the variables 'id', 'price', 'room_type', 'minimum_nights' and 'maximum_nights'. We also created two new variables by taking the mean average of the price and the mean average of the maximum number of nights.

For the availability variable, we chose to use every datapoint regardless of the datapoint being listed as available or not. This was done because the ones listed as not available might been rented out and those listings were exactly the rooms we want to know more about.

After the selection of the data we also created a new dummy variable called dummy_month_august, which is 1 if the row is in August/September (start of academic year) and 0 if it's in March/April.

Furthermore, we turned the variable room_type into a dummy variable called room. There are 4 different room types given but, as 2 of them make up a very small percentage of the dataset they were combined with one of the larger ones. The dummy variable is coded as "Entire home/apt" = 1 and 0 = "Private room"&" Shared room"& "Hotel room". We also theorized grouping these together made sense, as these types would be the most popular among students, because these accommodations are usually meant for 1 or 2 people.

For the Amsterdam dataset for example, these were the occurrences of each type;

| Entire home / apartment | Hotel room | Private room | Shared room |
|-------------------------|------------|--------------|-------------|
| 8446                    | 152        | 3680         | 64          |

After making boxplots and checking the summary output for our variable of interest. We removed the outliers for average_price and average_nights for all cities, as well as the outliers for the minimum number of nights for Berlin, as all these variables had extreme outliers which biased the mean and skewed the data.

We used a multiple methods to examine the datasets after transforming them. The full analysis on this can be found in the report.

The final variables in the datasets are as follows:

| Variable          | Description                                                                                                                                 |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| id                | Airbnb's unique identifier for the listing                                                                                                  |
| host_is_superhost | Boolean [t=true; f=false]                                                                                                                   |
| room_type         | Categorical variable displaying the the type of room, 4 options are given; Entire home/apartment, Hotel room, Private room or Shared room.  |
| room              | Binary variable. Transformed room_type, listing "Entire home/apartment" as 1 and "Private room"&" Shared room"& "Hotel room" combined as 0. |
| price             | Daily price in local currency, numeric.                                                                                                     |
| average_price     | Mean price for each listing over 30 days, numeric.                                                                                          |
| maximum_nights    | Maximum number of nights a listing can be rented out.                                                                                       |
| average_nights    | Mean maximum_nights for each listing over 30 days, numeric.                                                                                 |
| minimum_nights    | Minimum number of nights a listing can be rented out.                                                                                       |

##### Data exploration after transformation

|Price |
|Dataset: | Min. | 1st quartile | Median | Mean | 3rd quartile | Max. |
|----------|------------|------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Antwerp  | 14 | 65 | 80.88 | 90.95 | 110 | 213.28 |
| Amsterdam  | 0 | 111.5 | 155 | 173.4 | 220.5 | 397 |
| Brussels |0 | 51.58 | 70 | 74.83 | 93.42 | 158.12 |
| Berlin   |0 | 40 | 61 | 93.69 | 100 | 24999 |
| Rotterdam  | 25 | 75 | 109.9 | 144.1 | 158.3 | 1312.5 |

For price there is a large range of values. Take Berlin for example with some rooms listed as 24999. This may be that the person renting out the property incorrectly filled out the price or does not want to rent out the property but just list it. Some properties have a minimum price of 0 might indicate those are also listed but not intended to rent it out. This is the case for Amsterdam, Brussels and Berlin. The prices also differ greatly per city, Amsterdam’s median price is more than twice the median price for Berlin. Amsterdam is the most expensive city of the five based on median and mean. As there are some quite extreme outliers the median is more representative of the majority of the market. 

|Average nights |
|Dataset: | Min. | 1st quartile | Median | Mean | 3rd quartile | Max. |
|----------|------------|------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Antwerp  | 1 | 1 | 2 | 1.882 | 2 | 6 |
| Amsterdam  | 1 | 2 | 2.3 | 2.364 | 3 | 4.5 |
| Brussels |1 | 1 | 2 | 2.289 | 3 | 6 |
| Berlin   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 13.17 | 5 | 1124 |
| Rotterdam  | 1 | 1.25 | 2.0 | 6.087 | 4 | 360 |

The average nights variable shows great differences between the cities. In Amsterdam, Antwerp and Brussels, the mean average nights is around 2 nights, but in Berlin and Rotterdam this number is much higher. This might be because Berlin and Rotterdam both have high extremes, with 1124 days and 360 days as maximum respectively. On average, we can say guests prefer longer stays in Berlin and Rotterdam.


|Minimum nights |
|Dataset: | Min. | 1st quartile | Median | Mean | 3rd quartile | Max. |
|----------|------------|------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Antwerp  | 1 | 1 | 2 | 5.519 | 3 | 500 |
| Amsterdam  | 1 | 2 | 2 | 2.764 | 3 | 31 |
| Brussels | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2.844 | 3 | 999 |
| Berlin   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 11.46 | 5 | 1124 |
| Rotterdam  | 1 | 1 | 2 | 5.507 | 4 | 360 |

The mean minimum nights for all cities is 2 nights, except for Berlin where the median is 3 nights. The maximum minimum nights is much lower in Amsterdam compared to the other cities. In all other cities, there are some listings that can only be rented for a year or more per booking. 

|Maximum nights |
|Dataset: | Min. | 1st quartile | Median | Mean | 3rd quartile | Max. |
|----------|------------|------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Antwerp  | 1 | 35 | 365 | 617 | 1125 | 1125 |
| Amsterdam  | 1 | 21 | 180 | 496.3 | 1125 | 1825 |
| Brussels | 1 | 60 | 365 | 608.1 | 1125 | 1555 |
| Berlin   | 1 | 29 | 365 | 581.2 | 1125 | 9999 |
| Rotterdam  | 1 | 30 | 365 | 515.8 | 1125 | 1125 |

For the maximum nights we can see that on average median number of nights is a year for most cities. Only Amsterdam has fewer listed. This is likely because Amsterdam has a law about only being allowed to rent out your property for 30 days unless you get a permit. Rotterdam also has this rule but the allowed number of days are 60. So their median should be lower than the other cities as anyone listing their property without the permit can’t rent it out for long. So it’s quite odd then that Rotterdam still has this same high median as the other cities. This could mean that permits are perhaps easier to get there than in Amsterdam, or that this isn’t checked as often and people are breaking the rules. All of the cities appear to have a somewhat insanely high number for their max. Number of days, as this would mean you could rent the property for several years at a time. 

#### 2.2 Research method

This project will use a correlational research method. This is because we will use archival data for answering our research question.

#### 2.3 Analysis

In order to answer our research questions, we used linear regression models. A linear regression is used to predict the effects of one or more predictors on one dependent variable. In the regression, interaction effects can be measured as well. Per city (Amsterdam, Antwerp, Berlin, Brussels and Rotterdam), we performed one regression with the independent variable ('dummy_month_aug') on the price ('average_price') and one regression with the independent variable ('dummy_month_aug') on the maximum nights a listing was available ('average_nights'). This means that in total, we performed ten regression analyses.

## 3. Results

*Regression output explanation*

When running the regression we have checked the effect of the independent variable namely 'dummy_month_aug' for each of the five cities on the two dependent variables; 'average_price' and 'average_nights'. As the focus of our research is to identify whether the start of the academic year, represented by 'dummy_month_aug', has an effect on the DVs and also to see whether this effect depends on the moderators, we have introduced interaction effects between the IV of the study and the moderators, namely 'room' and 'host_is_superhostTRUE'.

```{r}

```

For the first city, Antwerp, we could not find any significant effects for the variables of interest.

```{r}

```

For Amsterdam there is a significant effect for the interaction between 'dummy_month_aug' and 'host_is_superhostTRUE', meaning that at the start of the academic year there is an increase of 11.5 euros in average price for Airbnb super hosts. For the other dependent variable we could not find any significant effects.

```{r}

```

In the case of Berlin we have a highly significant negative effect between the DV 'average price' and the start of the academic year, meaning there is a decrease of 28.56 euros in the price at the start of the academic year compared to March/April. Another significant effect for this DV is the interaction between start of the academic year and the room dummy, meaning that the average price at the start of the academic year increases by 24.3 euros for homes and apartments. For the other DV, 'average_nights' no significant effects were found.

```{r}

```

For Brussels, no significant effects were found for either of the DVs.

```{r}

```

Lastly, for Rotterdam for the DV 'average price' there is a significant effect with the IV 'dummy_month_aug'. On average prices are lower by 22.9 euros in August/September compared to March/April.

## 4. Discussion

Lack of significant effects in the model can be due to the large amount of observations in the sample. Another possible explanation can be that not many students use Airbnb's services in these cities. We also have to keep in mind we are comparing the data from 2022 to 2023. So the prices listed for March/April might be changed closer to that time. Furthermore with all the price increases recently it's possible that the price going up for March/April seen in Berlin is caused by the room owners expecting increases in the cost of material or goods they need for the room. But this would presumably be the case for all cities, unless there were cultural differences between the countries.

*Conclusion*

According to the expectations of this analysis we would have found that the start of the academic year will positively influence the average price of Airbnbs, as students in need of temporary housing use Airbnb's services to find accommodation, resulting in higher demand and hosts increasing prices. However, the results did not confirm our expectations as Airbnb prices were considerably lower in August than in March in all the cities where we found significant effects. Another expectation of the study was that average nights would increase as well at the start of the academic year, since students looking for permanent accommodation might need a few weeks or even months to succeed. Despite these expectations we found no significant effects for average nights for any of the cities, therefore, we can conclude that the start of the academic year has no significant effect on the average nights Airbnb users spend at an accommodation.\
